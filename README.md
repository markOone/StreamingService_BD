## **1. Summary of Requirements**

- **Stakeholder Needs**: The system requires a robust backend to manage a subscription-based streaming service. Key needs to include user account management (registration, login), a comprehensive movie catalog (information on movies, directors, actors), and a complete subscription lifecycle system (plan selection, payment processing, subscription status management).
- **Data to be stored**:
  - **User Data**: User profile information, including names, contact details (email), credentials, and birthdate.
  - **Content Catalog**: Detailed information for movies (title, description, year, rating), directors (biography), actors (biography), and the specific roles (performances) actors played in movies.
  - **Subscription and Financial Data**: Descriptions of available subscription plans (name, price, duration), records of user subscriptions (start/end dates, status), and a history of all payments (amount, timestamp, status).
- **Business Rules**:
  - A movie must have exactly one director, but a director can helm zero or more movies.
  - A movie can feature zero to many actor performances (to accommodate films like animations). An actor can perform in zero or more movies.
  - A user can have zero or many subscriptions over time and can make zero or many payments.
  - A subscription plan can contain many movies, and a single movie can be included in zero or many different plans.
  - Each specific user subscription instance is based on one specific plan.
  - Each payment is made by one user for user subscription.

## **2. Entities, Attributes, and Relationships**

**Entities: Actor, Performance, Movie, Director, Payment, User, User_Subscription, Subscription_Plan, Included_Movie**

**Attributes:**

- **Actor: (PK)** actor_id, name, surname, biography
- **Performance: (PK)** performance_id, character_name, description, **(FK)** actor_id, **(FK)** movie_id
- **Movie:** movie_id, title, description, year, rating, **(FK)** director_id
- **Director:** director_id, name, surname, biography
- **Incleded_Movie:** **composite PK** (**(FK)** movie_id, **(FK)** subscription_plan_id)
- **Subscription_Plan: (PK)** subscription_plan_id, name, description, price, duration
- **User_Subscription: (PK)** user_subscription_id, start_time, end_time, status, **(FK)** subscription_plan_id
- **Payment: (PK)** payment_id, timestamp, amount, status, **(FK)** subscription_plan_id
- **User: (PK)** user_id, name, surname, email, password, birthday, **(FK)** user_subscription_id

**Relationships:**

- **Actor (one and only one ⇔ zero or many) Performance**
> In a low-budget movie, one actor can play a few roles. An actor can have zero performances if the movie was deleted
- **Movie (one and only one ⇔ zero or many) Performance**
> Cartoons don't have actors
- **Director (one and only one ⇔ zero or many) Movie**
> A director can have zero movies if the movie was deleted
- **Movie (one and only one ⇔ zero or many) Included_Movie**
> A movie can exist on a streaming service but not be included in any subscription
- **Subscription_Plan (one and only one ⇔ one or many) Included_Movie**
- **Subscription_Plan (one and only one ⇔ one and only one) User_Subscription**
- **User_Subscription (one and only one ⇔ zero or many) Payment**
- **User (one and only one ⇔ zero or many) User_Subscription**
